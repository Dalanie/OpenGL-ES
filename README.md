OpenGL-ES
=========

buildingGL is a part of an application which is developed for the usage in Indoor-Evacuation scenarios.
It shows a building which can be rotated, translated and scaled. In addition it shows your current position
within the building, the shortest path out of the building, the exits of the building and some further information.
This is only a small part of the real application - it's created to test stuff around the visualization of the building without having the whole rest of the application being loaded every time.

buildingGL is written in OpenGL ES 2 - these are my first steps into the 3d-area so there might be some silly mistakes
made by myself. The building data was exported by an application called YAMAMOTO, which is also used during my work at the University of Melbourne.
